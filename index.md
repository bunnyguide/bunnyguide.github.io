title: First Bunny Starter Guide

Getting a new pet bunny is an exciting event, but before you bring your new furry friend home, you should make sure you have everything you need to make them comfortable and happy.

## The Immediate Necessities

### Food

There are three main components to a domestic bunny's diet: Hay, pellets, and fresh greens/vegetables. If your new bunny is less than six months old, it's too early to introduce the fresh part of their diet, and all you'll need is alfalfa hay and pellets. See the bunny diet page for information on the food you need for your new pet.


### Litter


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>One of the great features of having bunnies as pets is that they are so easy to litter train. They will naturally just start using a litter box if it is left in their space (though young ones may take a little while, they will learn this eventually). However, there are two issues you need to consider when figuring out what your bunny's litter situation will be.</td>

### Water bottle

You can get a water bottle or a water dish for your bunny. With all the fluff and hay floating around in their living space, I think a water bottle is the cleaner and safer option.



### Pet carrier

Of course, you need some way of bringing your new friend home, and some way of transporting them when you need to bring them to the vet. A simple small dog or cat carrier will do the job. Put in some soft towels, and some hay for them to snack on and you're ready to go.

### Housing

Housing a bunny is a little bit different than housing a dog or a cat. They need space to run around, but you may not want to give them free reign of your home since they can chew on wires and wood paneling/furniture.

One option is to keep them in a large cage when they are unsupervised. Large dog crates work great for this. To give your bun more space to run around, you can also get an exercise pen (or the excercise pen can be their normal enclosure if you have the space to always have it set up). Others choose to keep their bunny outdoors in a hutch.

You can read more about options on the housing page.

## Other accessories

### Nail trimmers

You'll need to trim your bunny's nails every month or so. When the bunny's nails get too long they can get caught on things or even curl back in and cause pain to the bunny. You can clip nails relatively easily if you have the right clippers. I like these ones, they have a guard that will keep you from accidentally cutting off too much of the nail.

grooming brush

Bunnies go through shedding cycles, so you'll need a good grooming brush. In my experience, the Furminator works best. Many others prefer silicone mid
