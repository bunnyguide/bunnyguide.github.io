title: First Bunny Starter Guide
---

Getting a new pet bunny is an exciting event, but before you bring your new furry friend home, you should make sure you have everything you need to make them comfortable and happy. This page gives you the essentials you should make sure you have immediately, as well as some additional items you won't want to go long without.

## The Immediate Necessities

### Food

There are three main components to a domestic bunny's diet: Hay, pellets, and fresh greens/vegetables. If your new bunny is less than six months old, it's too early to introduce the fresh part of their diet, and all you'll need is hay and pellets. For more information about what food you need for a rabbit who is more than six months old, or how to transition a rabbit from their juvenile diet to their adult diet, see the diet page.

    <td>Pellets are the highest calorie part of a rabbits diet. They are formulated to have everything that a rabbit needs nutritionally. There are different pellets formulated for young rabbits who are less than six months old, and adult rabbits. The young rabbit pellets are higher calorie and have more nutrients that a bunny needs as they grow. Rabbits should have unlimited access to as many pellets as they want until they are six months old. Once your rabbit is six months old, you should start transitioning your rabbit to the adult pellets and limit their pellet intake to about half a cup per 6 lbs body weight of the rabbit. For more information about this transition, see the diet page.</td>

    <td>Hay is an incredibly important part of a rabbits diet. For their entire lives, they should have unlimited access to hay. The fiber and hay keeps their digestive system flowing, and avoids G.I. stasis, a common and very serious issue in bunnies. Young rabbits less than six months old should have alfalfa hay, though you can also introduce them to other types of grass hay such as Timothy or Orchard grass. Older rabbits should not have alfalfa hay, but can have any other type of hay. For more information, check out the diet page or the hay page.</td>

### Litter


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>One of the great features of having bunnies as pets is that they are so easy to litter train. They will naturally just start using a litter box if it is left in their space (though young ones may take a little while, they will learn this eventually). However, there are two issues you need to consider when figuring out what your bunny's litter situation will be.</td>

### Water bottle

You can get a water bottle or a water dish for your bunny. With all the fluff and hay floating around in their living space, I think a water bottle is the cleaner and safer option.



### Pet carrier

Of course, you need some way of bringing your new friend home, and some way of transporting them when you need to bring them to the vet. A simple small dog or cat carrier will do the job. Put in some soft towels, and some hay for them to snack on and you're ready to go.

### Housing

Housing a bunny is a little bit different than housing a dog or a cat. They need space to run around, but you may not want to give them free reign of your home since they can chew on wires and wood paneling/furniture.

One option is to keep them in a large cage when they are unsupervised. Large dog crates work great for this. To give your bun more space to run around, you can also get an exercise pen (or the excercise pen can be their normal enclosure if you have the space to always have it set up). Others choose to keep their bunny outdoors in a hutch.

You can read more about options on the housing page.

## Other accessories

### Nail trimmers

You'll need to trim your bunny's nails every month or so. When the bunny's nails get too long they can get caught on things or even curl back in and cause pain to the bunny. You can clip nails relatively easily if you have the right clippers. I like these ones, they have a guard that will keep you from accidentally cutting off too much of the nail.

grooming brush

Bunnies go through shedding cycles, so you'll need a good grooming brush. In my experience, the Furminator works best. Many others prefer silicone mid
