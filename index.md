Getting a new pet bunny is an exciting event, but before you bring your new furry friend home, you should make sure you have everything you need to make them comfortable and happy. This page gives you the essentials you should make sure you have immediately, as well as some additional items you won't want to go long without. I've tried to list not only the items you need, but also a link to a suggested product on Amazon that would fit this need. I also describe what to consider when purchasing, so you can make an informed choice if you decide to go with a different product.

## Food

There are three main components to a domestic bunny's diet: Hay, pellets, and fresh greens/vegetables. If your new bunny is less than six months old, it's too early to introduce the fresh part of their diet, and all you'll need is hay and pellets. For more information about what food you need for a rabbit who is more than six months old, or how to transition a rabbit from their juvenile diet to their adult diet, see the diet page.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Pellets are the highest calorie part of a rabbits diet. They are formulated to have everything that a rabbit needs nutritionally. There are different pellets formulated for young rabbits who are less than six months old, and adult rabbits. The young rabbit pellets are higher calorie and have more nutrients that a bunny needs as they grow. Rabbits should have unlimited access to as many pellets as they want until they are six months old. Once your rabbit is six months old, you should start transitioning your rabbit to the adult pellets and limit their pellet intake to about half a cup per 6 lbs body weight of the rabbit. For more information about this transition, see the diet page.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Hay is an incredibly important part of a rabbits diet. For their entire lives, they should have unlimited access to hay. The fiber and hay keeps their digestive system flowing, and avoids G.I. stasis, a common and very serious issue in bunnies. Young rabbits less than six months old should have alfalfa hay, though you can also introduce them to other types of grass hay such as Timothy or Orchard grass. Older rabbits should not have alfalfa hay, but can have any other type of hay. For more information, check out the diet page or the hay page.</td>

## Litter

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>One of the great features of having bunnies as pets is that they are so easy to litter train. They will naturally just start using a litter box if it is left in their space (though young ones may take a little while, they will learn this eventually). While you can use any size appropriate cat litter box for your rabbit, one of the major issues that people often run into having rabbits as pets is how messy they can be, flinging their hay and poops everywhere as they jump out of their litter box. To cut down on this considerably, consider getting a litter box with a lip on it. This will make your life much easier, keep your place looking much cleaner, and cut down on all of the sweeping up you'll have to do.</td>
    <td>Litter Box with Lip<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Catit-Cat-Litter-Pan-Taupe/dp/B008F5QANI/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1543009911&sr=1-6&keywords=litter+box+with+lip&linkCode=li2&tag=tblanchard-20&linkId=10771d4544510dee0d43aac6212e2991&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B008F5QANI&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=tblanchard-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=tblanchard-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=B008F5QANI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /><a href="https://amzn.to/2DGz6IW" class="button">Find on Amazon</a> </td>

## Water bottle

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>You can get a water bottle or a water dish for your bunny. With all the fluff and hay floating around in their living space, I think a water bottle is the cleaner and safer option. Make sure to get a relatively large one, since rabbits drink a fair amount. 64-ounces is a good amount.</td>
    <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lixit-Corporation-SLX0670-Weather-64-Ounce/dp/B0050ICKN2/ref=as_li_ss_il?th=1&linkCode=li2&tag=tblanchard-20&linkId=a8f3eb157ca41157f18bef4ac7116ac3&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B0050ICKN2&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=tblanchard-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=tblanchard-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=B0050ICKN2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /><a href="https://amzn.to/2qZseyQ" class="button">Find on Amazon</a> </td>

## Pet carrier

Of course, you need some way of bringing your new friend home, and some way of transporting them when you need to bring them to the vet. A simple small dog or cat carrier will do the job. It's actually better if it's a fairly small carrier without much space for your rabbit to move around. This is just to keep them from moving around too much and hurting themselves while in transport. Don't worry! Your rabbit will only be in there temporarily so it's fine if they  can't move around much (as long as they can at least turn around in it). The other feature you should look for is a carrier that the rabbit won't be able to see too much out of. Being able to see that there high up might frighten them. I normally cover the carrier in a blanket when transporting my rabbits. Put in some soft towels, and some hay for them to snack on and you're ready to go.

## Housing

Housing a bunny is a little bit different than housing a dog or a cat. They need space to run around, but you may not want to give them free reign of your home since they can chew on wires and wood paneling/furniture.

One option is to keep them in a large cage when they are unsupervised. Large dog crates work great for this. Others choose to keep their bunny outdoors in a hutch. You can read more about options on the housing page.

Exercise pens are great and can be used instead of a cage as a primary indoor living space for bunnies. You can also use them indoors or outdoors as easily transported play areas for your pet in areas where you don't want them roaming free. You can even line up the doors of their cage and exercise pen to give them more room to hang out in without giving them complete free reign. They're foldable and easy to move, making them very versatile. Make sure they're tall enough though, rabbits can hop over them if they're too short!

# Other accessories

The following items are things that you might not need immediately, but are good purchases for keeping your bunny happy and healthy in the long term.

## Nail trimmers

You'll need to trim your bunny's nails every month or so. When the bunny's nails get too long they can get caught on things or even curl back in and cause pain to the bunny. You can clip nails relatively easily if you have the right clippers. I like these ones, they have a guard that will keep you from accidentally cutting off too much of the nail, making it much less stressful for both you and your bunny.

## Grooming Brush

Bunnies go through shedding cycles, so you'll need a good grooming brush. In my experience, the Furminator works best. Though made for cats, the Furminator works great for any fur, including the finer fur of certain breeds (like Holland Lops) that other brushes often aren't very effective on.

## Hidey Hole

Bunnies like to have something to hide in. It's nice to have some kind of small safe place for them to hide in when they're feeling scared. Tropical Fiddle Sticks work well for this, especially for young, small bunnies. You can also try cardboard boxes with holes in them, though mine have never seemed comfortable hiding in those. For other ideas you can see the toys page.

## Toys

Speaking of toys, you should make sure you have something for your bunnies to play with. There are a bunch of potential options, for young bunnies it's nice to get them something that they can play with and also chew on. Every bunny is a little bit different, but mine love this small barrel roller, which they chew on, roll around, and pick up and toss. It makes a good starter toy. For other ideas on entertainment for your pet, check out the toys page.

## Tubing for Rabbit Proofing Wires

Many rabbits seem to think wires are designed to be a tasty treat for them. The best way to protect your wires is to make it so your rabbits are unable to get to them. Failing that, one thing you can do is get plastic tubing to run your wires through to offer them protection. 3/8" thick tubing is wide enough to fit pretty much any wire in it, while not being too wide to be unwieldy.

## Area Rug

Most bunnies don't like hardwood or laminate floor, and will either avoided or be unable to hop and play on it. If you have carpeted, unfortunately rabbits can sometimes tear it up or work hay deep into it that you'll never get out. So it's nice to have an area rug over the area you expect your bunnies to plan. These work great with xpens that you can just put on top of the carpet. I suggest you get a pretty cheap one, so that it's not a big deal if your rabbit quickly ruins it.

## Book

Finally, it's always good to know as much as possible about how to take care of your pet. There are a lot of good resources around for learning about how to take care of a domestic rabbit. Reading a book is a good way to get all of your information in one place, so youget a complete picture of how to take care of your new pet.
