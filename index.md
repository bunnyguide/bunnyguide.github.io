Getting a new pet bunny is an exciting event, but before you bring your new furry friend home, you should make sure you have everything you need to make them comfortable and happy.

# The Immediate Necessities

## Food

There are three main components to a domestic bunny's diet: Hay, pellets, and fresh greens/vegetables. If your new bunny is less than six months old, it's too early to introduce the fresh part of their diet, and all you'll need is alfalfa hay and pellets. See the bunny diet page for information on the food you need for your new pet.


## Litter

They will naturally just start using a litter box if it is left in their space (though young ones may take a little while, they will learn this eventually). However, there are two issues you need to consider when figuring out what your bunny's litter situation will be. |
